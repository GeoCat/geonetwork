# From spec:
#
# a buckets property (array) where each item contains:
#
#a count property identifying the number of matches for a property name on which the facet was computed against.
#
#either:
#
#a value property identify the name of the bucket
#or a set of min and max properties identifying the range of values in that bucket.
#
# I could have subclassed these, but its more complicated because the discriminator would be in the parent object.
# This should be fine!

  "x-highest-bucket":
    description: for histogram buckets, true -> this is the highest-value bucket.  To get records, use "property <= max" instead of the usual  "property <= max".  Typically, this is only needed for fixed-number-of-buckets histograms.  Client should be able to compute this, but its here to make the client simplier.
